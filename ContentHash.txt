c#Basics#HelloWorld#1#Your First Java Program, Let's start by creating a simple program printing “Hello World” to the screen.#
c#Basics#HelloWorld#1#Hello World was the first message displayed by the Macintosh personal computer in 1984 and is the traditional first program written when learning to code.#
c#Basics#HelloWorld#1# class Java101 {public static void main(String[ ] args) {System.out.println("Hello World");}}#
c#Basics#HelloWorld#1#In Java, every line of code that will run needs to be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Java101. You will learn more about classes in the upcoming modules.#
c#Basics#HelloWorld#1#In Java, each application has an entry point, or a starting point, which is a method called main. Along with main, the keywords public and static will also be explained later. 
c#Basics#HelloWorld#1#As a summary:(1) Every program in Java must have a class. (2)Every Java program starts from the main method.
